# Brief Client Summary
For this project, our client was Artemis Financial, a consulting company specializing in financial planning. They tasked us with modernizing their operations, particularly focusing on enhancing the security of their web application to protect client data during data transfer.

# Security Vulnerability Handling
I demonstrated strong skills in identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities in Artemis Financial's software. Secure coding is vital as it ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, which is crucial for maintaining trust with clients and safeguarding the company's reputation.

# Challenges in Vulnerability Assessment
The most challenging aspect of vulnerability assessment was dealing with browser compatibility issues when implementing HTTPS protocol. Such challenges are common in real-world scenarios and required careful troubleshooting and problem-solving skills to overcome.

# Increasing Layers of Security
I increased layers of security by implementing various measures such as choosing a robust encryption algorithm (SHA-256), generating self-signed certificates, deploying cryptographic hash algorithms, and ensuring secure communication via HTTPS. In the future, I would use comprehensive vulnerability assessment tools and techniques like penetration testing to identify and prioritize vulnerabilities and determine appropriate mitigation techniques.

# Functional and Security Checks
After refactoring the code, I ensured its functionality and security through thorough testing. I utilized secondary static testing with OWASP Dependency-Check Maven to identify any introduced vulnerabilities. This iterative approach ensures that the code remains functional while addressing security concerns.

# Resources and Tools Used
In this assignment, I utilized tools like Java Keytool in Eclipse for certificate generation, OWASP Dependency-Check Maven for static testing, and industry-standard encryption algorithms. Additionally, I followed secure coding practices such as input validation and secure communication protocols. These resources, tools, and practices will be invaluable in future assignments or tasks requiring secure software development.

# Showcasing to Future Employers
From this assignment, I can showcase my ability to identify and address security vulnerabilities, implement secure coding practices, and deploy security measures in a real-world scenario. I can demonstrate my proficiency in using industry-standard tools and practices to ensure the security and functionality of software applications, which is highly valuable to potential employers in any software development role.
